# News Classification

## clustering (unsupervised on word2vec model)

## word2vec log likelyhood

## word2vec as doc2vec

## cnn

problems:
- random initialization (missing words) needs same distribution
- padding (how avoided) (maybe: is it really a problem when worde repititions from article beginning)
- same a-priori (overfitting to a-priori as parameter)
    - solved through equalization of a-priori

## results & comparison of methods
